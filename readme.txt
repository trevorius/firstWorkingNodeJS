first app using nodeJS 

credit: much of the base of this program was made by a collegue "Jdup29" with whom i shared research on the subject.
    research was mainly youtube tutorials from :    "lets build that app" channel
                                                    "programming with Mosh" channel
    also used      https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/jquery/jquery-post-method      as a non ideo tutorial.                    

-- you must first in the terminal run app.js using nodemon : $ nodemon app

-- then open form.html on locslhost:<portnumber>

-- have fun entering numbers...
